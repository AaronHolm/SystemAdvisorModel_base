# SystemAdvisorModel_base
Using NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM), this program provides a basic, generic framework to be used for adapting other scripts. While SAM is written in C, NREL does provide several language wrappers, including a python wrapper which this repository utilizes.

The SAM Simular Core (SSC) SDK is a collection of developer tools for creating renewable energy system models using the SSC library. You can learn more about NREL, SAM and the SAM SDK at: https://sam.nrel.gov/sdk


As this relies on the SAM SDK, which is a custom module, users will need to download and install the SAM SDK from NREL.
